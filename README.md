Hello world!

My name is Craig. I have just started learning how to code! I started with Python on Codecamedy, and I've moved now to SQL. I do not really know enough to have an educated opinion on which language I like best. Python was a lot of fun to learn, and so has SQL so far. I'd like to dip into every common language I can (node.js, Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Django, React, AWS)
